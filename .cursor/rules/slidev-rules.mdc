## Structure

- Each topic gets its own file, which gets linked in `/slides.md`
- Each topic file is saved in /pages/{topic}/{name-of-the-topic}.md
- A topic can consist of the files (see 4-mat principle)
  - why.md
  - how.md
  - what.md
  - task.md
  - what-if.md
- Each topic starts with a cover slide
- Each topic ends with a task slide (also a cover with the title of the respective exercise)

### Example

```
/
├── slides.md                   # Main slides file
├── sources.md                  # Sources of the presentation
├── pages/                      # Topic organization
│   ├── introduction/           # Topic folder
│   ├── components/             # Topic folder
│   └── services/               # Topic folder
│       ├── why.md              # Topic file
│       ├── how.md              # Topic file
│       ├── what.md             # Topic file
│       ├── task.md             # Topic file
│       └── what-if.md          # Topic file
├── components/                 # Reusable slide components
├── snippets/                   # Code snippets
└── assets/                     # Images and media
```

### Link in slides.md

```md
---
src: ./pages/introduction/welcome.md
---
```

## Slide

### Basics

- The front matter where settings of the slide are defined has 3 `-` above and 3 `-` below
- The analysed code dictates the content.
  - ifthe resarch finds more content it is mentioned in the outlook as interesting topic
- All sources used to generate the slides are collected in its own slide-deck `sources.md`
  - Each slide in `sources.md` can habe up to 5 sources listed
- Avoid HTML if possible
- Only use it for specialities and use https://unocss.dev/, if needed
- Prefer Markdown over custom HTML for lists
- Prefer HTML over Markdown when it comes to info boxes highlighting important statements

### Example

```md
---
layout: default
---
```

### Text

- List text should fit in one line
- Text should not flow over slide
- Be clear and concise
- Avoid content duplications

### Images in Slides

- If the Slide has a list or text, prefer 2-column layout
  - one column contains the text/list, the other an image
- Search for images that match the text/list contents online (eg. https://unsplash.com)

### Code Example in slide

- Never use more than 2 Code-Blocks in one Slide
- Never nest markdown code blocks inside HTML, due to parsing issues
- Prefer one code example per slide instead of have multiple
- Prefer simple code examples (a method)
- Use comment blocks /_ ... _/ to omit unimportant code lines
- Prefer code examples from 1-10 lines
- If code examples are longer than 10 lines avoid adding other elements on the slide (put them in the next slide)
- For comparison 2 code examples next to each other are fine
- Annotate each codeblock with correct programming language
- Embrace @Shiki to highlight important parts of the code
- Code should not fall out of the slide (overflow)
- Use line numbers if code examples have more than 4 lines
- If the code doesn't fit into one slide, you use the maxHeight to set a fixed height and enable scrolling:

```ts {2|3|7|12}{maxHeight:'100px'}
// Example maxHeight
function add(a: Ref<number> | number, b: Ref<number> | number) {
  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b));
}
/// ...as many lines as you want
const c = add(1, 2);
```

### Mermaid

- Use mermaid graphs for processes & flows

## Layouts

- If a layout repeats during slide, create a new slidev layout and reuse it for other slides

## Didactics

- Ensure each module follows the 4-MAT learning cycle

### 4-MAT Teaching Structure

For each major concept identified in the commits, structure the learning using the 4-MAT system:

1. **WHY (Connection)** - 25% of content
   - Begin with why this Angular feature/approach matters
   - Connect to real-world problems it solves
   - Use concrete examples from the codebase to demonstrate pain points addressed
   - Appeal to intuition and personal meaning

2. **WHAT (Conceptual)** - 25% of content
   - Present the core concepts and facts
   - Show code from the repository that implements these concepts
   - Provide clear explanations of how the feature works in Angular
   - Present the theoretical foundation behind the implementation

3. **HOW (Practice)** - 25% of content
   - Show step-by-step application in code examples from the repository
   - Create exercises based on actual commit changes
   - Demonstrate implementation patterns and best practices as seen in the code
   - Guide through practical application scenarios

4. **WHAT IF (Creative Application)** - 25% of content
   - Explore extensions and variations of the concepts
   - Discuss edge cases and how to handle them
   - Encourage creative problem-solving using the learned concepts
   - Show alternative approaches or future possibilities

## Quality

- Double check if all files/slides are reachable (are the paths correct)
- Check for empty slides and remove them
